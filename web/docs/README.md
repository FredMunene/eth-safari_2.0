## 🧭 Hackathon Guidelines

- Build something useful fast, then iterate—judges reward shipped MVPs with a clear roadmap.
- Document progress daily in your repo (README, Loom, quick demos) so mentors can jump in.
- Prioritize measurable impact for African communities; clearly state the user story and on-chain components.
- Respect open-source licenses and disclose any AI-assisted code generation in your submission.
- Submit via the [DoraHacks platform](https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/eth-safari-hackathon-2025/detail) before the final deadline; late entries cannot be scored.

## 💧 What Is Aqua Protocol?

Aqua Protocol is a cryptographic framework for building distributed trust networks. It enables scalable, trustless verification of data integrity and provenance, empowering developers to certify and secure data in an open, private, and decentralized way—ideal for DeFi analytics, supply-chain proofs, and interoperable identity systems.

## 🎯 Aqua Bounty Challenges

Choose any challenge (or combine them if you have the stamina):

1. **UX Showcase:** Ship a refreshed Aqua Protocol landing page with improved onboarding flows, dark mode, and mobile-first layouts validated by quick user tests.
2. **Trust Explorer:** Prototype a dashboard that visualizes Aqua attestations across partner ecosystems, including alerts for stale or conflicting proofs.
3. **AI + Aqua Copilot:** Build an AI assistant that translates natural-language compliance queries into Aqua verification checks.
4. **Civic Trust Playbook:** Design a toolkit for African municipalities to publish tamper-proof environmental or health data through Aqua, featuring templates and governance guardrails.
5. **Developer Experience Kit:** Create Figma assets + component library + documentation snippets that protocol teams can drop into their portals.

Use the Submit button on the DoraHacks platform when you’re ready. One polished entry is enough for judging, but you can submit multiple entries if time allows.

## 🔍 Idea Deep Dives (Plain English)

### 1. Trust Explorer Dashboard
- **Problem it solves:** Today, no one has a simple way to see which datasets or partners are actually verified on Aqua.
- **What to build:** A web dashboard that lists every attestation, shows who issued it, and flashes an alert if data gets stale or two sources disagree.
- **Impact story:** Investors and compliance teams gain instant confidence because they can literally see trusted data across Africa-focused ecosystems.

### 2. AI + Aqua Copilot
- **Problem it solves:** Regulators and compliance officers ask questions like “Does this loan pool pass the KYC checks?” but translating that into Aqua queries is hard.
- **What to build:** A chat-like assistant (could be simple rules or LLM-backed) where the user types a question and your app calls Aqua to verify the answer.
- **Impact story:** Speeds up audits, lowers compliance costs, and makes Aqua approachable for non-technical stakeholders.

### 3. Civic Trust Playbook
- **Problem it solves:** Cities want to prove public data (air quality, water safety) isn’t tampered with, but lack a ready-made process.
- **What to build:** A starter kit with data templates, publishing scripts, and community dashboard mockups so a municipality can post verified metrics via Aqua in a week.
- **Impact story:** Citizens and NGOs gain transparency; governments earn trust by sharing tamper-proof data on critical services.

## 🤝 Mapping Ideas to ETH Safari Pain Points

Judges specifically highlighted three operational gaps. Here’s how you can address them:

1. **Community Communication & Engagement**
   - Layer a “Town Hall” announcement feed into the Trust Explorer so organizers can broadcast verified updates (schedule changes, bounty clarifications) signed via Aqua.
   - Extend the Civic Trust Playbook to include community polling and feedback templates, turning verified data into dialogue.

2. **Structured Community Involvement**
   - Build a lightweight role registry: contributors sign commitments (design, mentoring, outreach) as Aqua attestations so everyone can see who owns what.
   - Offer reputation points inside the AI Copilot—mentors who answer questions get verifiable badges, motivating deeper participation.

3. **People, Logistics, and Travel Management**
   - Create an “ETH Safari Ops Hub” module that issues travel approvals, stipend disbursement proofs, and volunteer shift check-ins as Aqua records.
   - Integrate QR check-ins for venues; each scan creates a signed event so logistics teams know who is on-site without juggling spreadsheets.

Pick one gap as your north star, then combine it with the Aqua-focused idea that best solves it. Judges will love seeing their real problems addressed with verifiable infrastructure.

### 🧩 Ops Hub Concept (Deep Dive)
- **Core users:** Operations leads, volunteers, sponsored travelers, finance approvers.
- **Workflow snapshot:**
  1. Traveler submits itinerary → Ops Hub issues an Aqua attestation with approval status + stipend amount.
  2. On arrival, volunteer scans a venue QR code → scan triggers a signed “check-in” event tied to the traveler’s attestation.
  3. Finance marks stipends as disbursed → Aqua proof is linked to the same record, closing the loop.
- **Why Aqua matters:** Every step (approval, presence, payment) is tamper-proof, so Ops teams ditch spreadsheets and auditors can verify logistics in seconds.
- **MVP surface:** Single dashboard that lists participants, their approval QR, live attendance feed, and payout state; plus lightweight mobile web page for scanning/confirming.

## 🖥️ UI Build Brief

Use this write-up to generate page designs or UI components quickly:

1. **Ops Hub Dashboard**
   - Hero metric cards (approved travelers, arrivals today, payouts pending).
   - Table with participant photo/name, travel status, stipend status, latest check-in timestamp.
   - Live activity feed showing Aqua-signed events (approvals, scans, payouts) with verification badges.

2. **Travel Approval Workspace**
   - Form fields: name, role, itinerary, stipend amount, sponsor notes.
   - Sidebar preview of the Aqua attestation payload + QR token ready for printing/sharing.
   - CTA buttons: “Save Draft”, “Issue Approval (mint attestation)”.

3. **Participant Timeline Modal**
   - Chronological chips for Approval → QR scan(s) → Stipend disbursement.
   - Status color coding (pending, success, needs attention) and links to raw proofs.

4. **QR Check-In Scanner**
   - Mobile-friendly camera view, fallback manual code entry.
   - Confirmation screen with attendee details, location, timestamp, and “Sync to Aqua” action.
   - Error states for expired approvals or duplicate scans.

5. **Finance Payout Console**
   - Kanban or table view of pending stipends with attachment uploader (receipt/hash).
   - “Mark as Paid” triggers attestation update; show success toast + log entry.

Design cues: calm ops palette (sand/green), high-contrast states for urgency, and iconography that reinforces “verified trust”. Ensure pages degrade gracefully on low bandwidth and have offline queueing hints for QR scans.
